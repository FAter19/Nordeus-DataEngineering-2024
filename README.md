# Nordeus-DataEngineering-2024
Nordeus Data Enginnering Challenge Solution

A solution to the Top Eleven Data Challenge can be found in this repository. To extract insights and provide API endpoints for data querying, the challenge entails cleaning, processing, and analysing JSONL datasets from a Top Eleven game.

Features
- Data cleaning: Using a thorough validation procedure, duplicates, and invalid events are eliminated.
- SQL Integration: Enables effective querying by storing the processed data in a SQL database.
- REST API: Offers endpoints for retrieving statistics at the user and game levels.
- Session Data Processing: Uses sophisticated techniques to handle session data accurately without depending on the type column.

Python was utilised for data processing and the implementation of REST APIs.
To construct the REST API, use Flask.

Technologies
- Python: For implementing REST APIs and processing data.
- SQLite: As the backend database for storing and querying the data.
- SQL: For efficient queries and organised data storage.

How to Use
The repository should be cloned.
Install dependencies and initialise the database by following the setup guidelines in the README.md file.
To analyse data or access the API, run the application locally.
This project exhibits strong documentation, clean code practices, and effective handling of complicated datasets.
